## How does a recommender system work?
Recommender systems function with two kinds of information:

-	Characteristic information. This is information about items (keywords, categories, etc.) and users (preferences, profiles, etc.).
-	User-item interactions. This is information such as ratings, number of purchases, likes, etc.

Based on this, we can distinguish between two major algorithms used in this movie recommender system:
-	Content-based systems, which use characteristic information.
-	Collaborative filtering systems, which are based on user-item interactions.
