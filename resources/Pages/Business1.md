Metrics are essential for measuring the effectiveness of a recommender system, and our content-based approach boasts impressive performance metrics. For instance, we track the precision and recall scores, indicating the system's ability to accurately recommend movies users will like and its coverage of relevant films. Our collaborative-based method, on the other hand, focuses on user satisfaction metrics like the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Lower MAE and RMSE scores signify that the system can predict user preferences with higher precision, leading to more personalized recommendations and greater user satisfaction.
